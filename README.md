### [What is Huffman Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)

Every person who is working in this field has a project that is the first and yes this was my first :). There are very poor programming standards and awful solutions, but whenever I look this repository, I'm happy, so I do not think to change.

This project was built on Qt Framework with C++. Some project parts do not work for example decoding. Improvements should be made for C++ coding standards, but I will not do this because nostalgia is good :).
